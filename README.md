### Evil Wordle
## (Work in Progress)
Its Wordle, but with a twist! Everytime you guess a available word, wordle will eliminate any of the words that have a letter associated that word. It will avoid every letter you typed in until there is one last word, which you can finally guess. Good luck!

## Why?
I thought of this idea after my professor showed us his Java program that he made, but it was with Hangman. The game, played in the console, would cross out any of the letters that you would guess, and when you ran out of guesses, it would display an actual word that would have none of the letters that you had guessed, but you wouldn't know that it secretly was going against you. Once Wordle blew up, I thought that it would be fun if someone did something similar with Wordle.

## How to Play
Simply guess a word! The rules are similar to the regular Wordle. The word bank, however, may be less than the actual Wordle word bank.
